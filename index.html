    <h1>Tribute to technology</h1>
    <p class="timeline-container">Technology has always been something I enjoyed. Now it is something I truly appreciate. 
    After the passing of my grandparents Eve Lindsey And Mario Medina the only thing I have left 
    of them is the pictures, videos, and voicemails. This may not sound like much but its means the world to me. <br><br>
    Because of technology my last memories of them dont only have to be in my head. By the click of a button I can hear their laugh, I can 
    listen to all the silly and heartfelt voicemails they left me, I can see their smile in every picture, and I can watch them dance in every video. So I wanted to make a tribute to technology 
    and the brilliant inventors that made this possible over time.
